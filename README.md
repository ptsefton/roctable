# roctable

This is an experimental project (for now) which was aimed at making a quick RO-Crate to table conversion like we do in RO-Crate-Tabulor - but more directly

This MAY become a general purpose javascript too for converting RO-Crates to and from  tabular formats INCLUDING multi-worksheet Excel, CSV, and sqlite

WARNING: This is not for production use - it's a sketch to try out a general approach to tabulation


## Install and prepare
```
npm install .

```

## Try it on the COOEE dataset:

```
node index.js test_data/cooee -c cooee-config.json
```
